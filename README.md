# Arduino Tachometer Calibrator
## What it does:
Arduino micro generates a signal to calibrate automotive air-core tachometers. The aftermarket tachometer pcb has a potentiometer that adjusts the range of the tachometer. This gizmo outputs a known frequency through the coil of a relay to simulate the tach output of an HEI distributer.
